This is an updated version of the { notify_agent_agenda.yaml } which is a way to automate sensor data into ChatGPT and have it sent back to your HA instance or Mobile device in human/ai text. 
All I did was updated { calendar.list_events } to { calendar.get_events } so we no longer get the errors in the logs.
